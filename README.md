# System Seed
This is a seed of a system for developers to begin their work with. This will inculde a login system and backend for developers.

This isn't a CMS project. Sometimes I recieve requests from clients to build a website in PHP and MySQL. For me, I prefer to build with WordPress. However some clients don't like to use a CMS. So I need to build the site from scratch. I don't like to reinvent the wheel every time I begin to build a website from scratch so I thought that a system like this will be useful.
